IntroductionTCS is short for Ternary Color Subtitle, it is specially built for the TCSub, and it’s part of the teco project. TCS is a file format that mainly stores raw pixel data as well as its position and living interval (consider of the GIF file format or any video file format). The default filename extension of a TCS file is .TCS. TCS FX stands for TCS karaoke effects, which means a karaoke effects that is stored in a TCS file. TCS is very different from the well-known subtitle file format SSA/ASS (SubStation Alpha/Advanced SubStation Alpha), it is not written but produced, if you want to create meaningful TCS FX you’ll have to use some special softwares that are compatible with TCS. Theoretically, TCS allows you to draw anything to video frames, although it is mainly created to store karaoke effects. After parsing the data stored in TCS file, you’ll get TCS frames, which are going to overlay on video frames. See also libtcs and TcsFilter. Aegisub Manual is also a good stuff to read.
